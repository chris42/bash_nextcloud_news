Bash script to mark plus articles read in nextcloud database in nextcloud newsreader, as most sites do not offer a special RSS feed without their paid content.
Supported plus websites:
- Spiegel plus
- faz.net plus
- Zeit plus
- Heise plus

The script was written for personal use, hence expecting a docker setup.
It was created to be run via the hosts cron and expects database credentials to be in /root/.my.cnf
within the database container (mariadb will look there)
